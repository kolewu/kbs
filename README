Quick start
-----------
   * Build [Tclkit] executables:
  ./kbs.tcl -r -mk install kbskit8.5
   * Build [Tclkit Lite] executables:
  ./kbs.tcl -r -vq install kbskit8.5
   * Build user defined batteries included executables:
  ./kbs.tcl -r -vqi-bi -bi=".." install kbskit8.5
   * Build kit-file:
  ./kbs.tcl -r install kbspkg8.5
   * Show used configuration:
  ./kbs.tcl config
   * Start graphical user interface:
  ./kbs.tcl gui
   * Display options and online help:
  ./kbs.tcl help

Build requirements
------------------

The following external programs are needed:
   * C-compiler, C++ compiler for metakit based programs
   * make with handling of VPATH variables (gmake)
   * cvs, svn (not yet used), tar, gzip, unzip to get and extract sources

To build under Windows you need the [msys] system and put the kbs-sources
inside the msys tree (/home/..).
