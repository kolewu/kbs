kbs.tcl ?options? mode ?args?
options:
  -pkgfile=?file?      contain used Package definitions
                       (default is 'sources/kbskit-8.5b3/kbskit.kbs')
  -builddir=?dir?      build directory, used with [Builddir]
                       (default is './build$tcl_platform(os)')
  -CC=?command?        set configuration variable _(CC)
                       (default is 'gcc' or existing environment variable 'CC')
  -i -ignore           ignore errors and proceed (default is disabled)
  -r -recursive        recursive Require packages (default is disabled)
  -v -verbose          display running commands and command output
  --enable-symbols
  --disable-symbols    set configuration variable _(SYMBOLS)
  --enable-64bit
  --disable-64bit      set configuration variable _(64BIT)
  --enable-threads
  --disable-threads    set configuration variable _(THREADS)
  --enable-aqua
  --disable-aqua       set configuration variable _(AQUA)
 mode:
  help                 this text
  version              return current version
  kbs                  return information about *.kbs commands
  gui                  start graphical user interface
  list ?pattern?       list packages matching pattern (default is *)
  require package ..   return call trace of packages
  sources package ..   get package source files (under sources/)
  configure package .. create [Makedir] (in [Builddir]) and configure package
  make package ..      make package (in [Makedir])
  install package ..   install package (in [Builddir])
  test package ..      test package
  clean package ..     remove make targets
  distclean package .. remove [Makedir]
package is used for glob style matching against available packages
(Beware, you need to hide the special meaning of * like foo\*)

The following configuration variables can be used:
_(64BIT)   = --disable-64bit
_(AQUA)    = --enable-aqua
_(CC)      = gcc
_(DIR)     = unix
_(SHARED)  = --enable-shared
_(STATIC)  = --disable-shared
_(SYMBOLS) = --disable-symbols
_(THREADS) = --enable-threads
_(TZDATA)  = --with-tzdata

Build requirements
------------------

The following external programs are needed:
   * C-compiler
   * make with handling of VPATH variables (gmake)
   * cvs, svn (not yet used), tar, gzip, unzip to get and extract sources

To build under Windows you need the [msys] system and put the kbs-sources
inside the msys tree (/home/..).
